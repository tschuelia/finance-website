# finance-website

Small django project for my private finances. Nothing special, I just was not happy with the finance tools on the market and decided to build my own customized tool :-)

The website provides functionality for managing multiple bank accounts, e.g. keeping track of transactions by uploading csv exports of the bank transfers and plotting spendings and incomes by categories.

This project is not really intended for public use since it is custom made for my own needs (e.g. the csv to transactions parsing and the initialization of category keywords).

Feel free to steal any code you like üëç
